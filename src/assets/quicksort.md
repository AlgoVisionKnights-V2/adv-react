# Overview

Quick Sort is a unique type of sorting algorithm compared to most other sorting algorithms. This is because quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. This means that quick sort separates the main probelm into several smaller problems such that when all of the smaller problems are solveed the larger problem is also solved.

# How does it work?

Quick sort is done by using several pivot points. The main idea is that a pivot point is set in an unsorted array and once this is done, all of the other elements will be compared to the pivot point. If the value being compared is less than the pivot, it is placed in its own sub-array. If the value is larger than the pivot it is also placed in its own sub-array. Hence, all the elements less than the pivot will be in one sub-array and all of the elements greater than the pivot will be in another sub-array. Then the exact same process is repeated on each respective sub-array until the length of a sub-array reaches 1.
